# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Agent Run/Stop control**: Separate agent lifecycle from WebUI — start/stop the agent at runtime without killing the server. New `AgentLifecycle` state machine (`stopped/starting/running/stopping`), REST endpoints (`POST /api/agent/start`, `/stop`, `GET /api/agent/status`), SSE endpoint (`GET /api/agent/events`) for real-time state push, `useAgentStatus` hook (SSE + polling fallback), and `AgentControl` sidebar component with confirmation dialog
- **MCP Streamable HTTP transport**: `StreamableHTTPClientTransport` as primary transport for URL-based MCP servers, with automatic fallback to `SSEClientTransport` on failure. `mcpServers` list is now a lazy function for live status. Resource cleanup (AbortController, sockets) on fallback. Improved error logging with stack traces

### Fixed
- **WebUI setup wizard**: Neutralize color accent overuse — selection states, warning cards, tag pills, step dots all moved to neutral white/grey palette; security notice collapsed into `<details>`; "Optional Integrations" renamed to "Optional API Keys"; bot token marked as "(recommended)"
- **Jetton send**: Wrap entire `sendJetton` flow in try/catch for consistent `PluginSDKError` propagation; remove `SendMode.IGNORE_ERRORS` (errors are no longer silently swallowed); fix `||` → `??` on jetton decimals (prevents `0` decimals being replaced by `9`)

## [0.7.0] - 2026-02-21

### Added
- **WebUI Setup Wizard**: 6-step guided onboarding flow (Welcome, Provider, Telegram, Config, Wallet, Connect) with shared Shell sidebar layout, React context state management, server-side validation mirror, and "Start Agent" button with seamless setup-to-dashboard transition
- **Local LLM Provider**: New "local" provider for OpenAI-compatible servers (Ollama, vLLM, LM Studio, llama.cpp) with auto-model discovery from `/models` endpoint, CLI `--base-url` option, and WebUI provider card
- `getEffectiveApiKey()` helper for consistent API key resolution across all LLM call sites
- ASCII banner for `teleton setup --ui` matching `teleton start`
- 86 setup route tests + 39 validation tests (898 total tests)

### Fixed
- **Security audit remediation (27 fixes)**: MCP env var blocklist, sendStory symlink-safe path validation (realpathSync), DB ATTACH/DETACH proxy for plugin isolation, BigInt float precision (string-based decimals), debounce clamp, SendMode.IGNORE_ERRORS removed, URL quote escaping, wallet JSON validation, pino redact, and more
- `fetchWithTimeout` (10s) + http/https scheme validation on local model discovery
- Model array capped to 500 entries to prevent unbounded growth
- Early exit when provider=local but `base_url` missing
- Non-interactive onboarding: relaxed `--api-key` for local/cocoon providers
- WebUI UX: CSS specificity fixes, bot token inline field, wallet address prominent display, TonAPI/Tavily as plain optional fields

## Note — 2026-02-21
